== Welcome to cltp 

This application will be used to track M1/M2 medical students to track
their clinical encounters for a multidimensional perspectives

1. LCME accreditation and compliance
2. Pedagogical model
3. Portfolio
4. Longitudinal and life-long repository 

== Getting Started

This application is built on Rails 2.3.8. It uses MySQL 5.1 as the
backend database. So make sure you have both installed.

To get going you need to:

1. Copy config/database.yml.template to config/database.yml
2. Create a database named cltp_dev in MySQL
3. Change the "development:" stanza in the config/database.yml so that
   the "username:" and "password:" specify a user that has sufficient
   privileges in the cltp_dev database.
4. Initialize the database. Details on how to do so will be shared
shortly.

This is at a prototype stage at present. Just invoke ./script/server
to fire up the app.
